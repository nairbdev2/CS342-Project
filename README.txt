How To Make the Program:
	Simply type "make" and you should be able to see it compile the 19 java files.


How To Run the Program:
	Type in "java ExamTester" without the quotes and the program will run.
	
BEFORE RUNNING PROGRAM:
	Please Change at the top of the examTester the directory for examfile.txt & ansFile.txt

Description:
	The purpose of the program is to have a blank exam SAVED as a text file. The Student then enter their name, 
answer all the questions, and has it save to a text file. The program can also read from the examFile text it's own questions back
and then the program also scans the ansFile text then can be utilized back into the program.



Note:
	I did have some trouble trying to save MCAnswers as an object and simply couldn't get it done. Every Other Answers is saved into
the program and can have it's data be utilized within.


OLD_Description (Same Old Functionality):
	The purpose of the program is to print out an Exam, Randomly reorder
a single or all MCQuestions' Answers, Randomly Reorder Questions, Display the total 
points of the exam, Have User input answer the questions in sequential order.

An example of what I did for Error checking would be to make sure the
test_user (or TA) would not put an out of bounds number for some array which
would very much likely crash the program.
